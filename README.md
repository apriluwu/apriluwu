# Hello~

Hi you might know me from various corners of the internet. I usually go by Rain nowaways but anything is fine really. I work in software and I'm a professional at messing around with linux in my free time. I also study philosophy in my free time. 

## Current projects

As of right now I am not working on anything mainly, I've started investing more time in other interests and decided to take a break from development due to burnout. I've recently come back though in hopes to find something fun to work on.

## Other little stuff!

- I don't mind any pronouns besides he/him
- I age regress and can be very slow at times - please be patient!
- I forget *a lot*, if you notice please let me know, I don't do it on purpose!
