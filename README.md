I'm a 15 y/o demigirl living in Virginia that's mainly focused on \*nix and some programming </br>
I mostly like to mess with linux and it's varients and I've recently started trying out BSD. I hope to go forward and make my own distro one day. </br>
I would like to possibly go into system administration when I'm older or possibly just continue developing FOSS software
